description: "Oil on Canvas Original Signed Painting by Marina Grigoryan Into the Music Unique Art. Painting Size: 170 x 90 cm 66.3 x 35.1 in Stretch About the Artist: Marina Grigoryan was born in 1963 in Russia. Grigoryan attended art school from 1974 to 1978 before enrolling at the Art Academy in 1978 to study easel painting under the guidance of Professor Nogmat Khakimov, and Lyubov Kuzina, senior lecturer in the Drawing and Composition Department. Upon her graduation in 1982, Grigoryan began her career as an artist by embarking on an ambitious ten year period of nearly non-stop participation in group and individual shows where she continued to honor her unique artistic talents. Her exposure to variety of experiences and people culminated in a desire to experience a complete “life makeover“, which she realized by immigrating to Israel in 1994. Grigoriyan’s paintings glow with an infusion of light and an amazing use of color that blend together to create an ambiance of almost fairy-like magic. &quot;Soothing“, &quot;exciting“, &quot;mysterious“, &quot;vibrant“, and &quot;alive“ are just some of the words that have been used to describe the artist’s work. Today, Grigoryan has added sculpture and ceramics to her repertoire and continues to perform as a professional artist. She has seen her work exhibited in Israel, America and Europe. Marina Grigoryan is represented by Tribes Fine Art Gallery, Tel Aviv. #PZN218",

This helps to prevent any damage that may occur to the varnish if the painting is stored during humid conditions, which would affect the look of the painting. So, when you order a painting, that is when your painting will be varnished. There is a waiting period of 1 to 2 weeks for the varnish to finish setting, before the piece is shipped out. ---------- Once payment has cleared, usually within 2-3 days, but it may take up to two weeks (hence, a 1 to 2 week shipping estimate) - and after the 1 to 2 week varnish-setting time, for paintings - your piece will be packaged and shipped using the best method available at the time. All orders will be shipped to the address on the Etsy receipt, unless otherwise noted. Orders will not be shipped to PO Boxes, so please provide an alternate address for orders to be shipped to. Once your order item has be delivered to the carrier for shipping, and tracking information has been obtained, that information will be shared with the customer via email, or through other provided contact information.",

BEYOND PAINTING AND WATERcolorARTbyROSIE Even more important than our painting to us is that we are able to donate some of our proceeds to those folks who face difficult times. Since life has been good to us, we feel that we should share. Every year we look for a worthy cause to donate some funds to. This year it was to a professional lady whose career had fallen because of the job market. She lost her home, her car and other things most of us take for granted. But she still has her pride, her energy and her desire. We know she will make it: we knew a little financial help was in order. In the past several years we got involved in assisting a young man and woman with children ; he had ALS. And an Iraqi Veteran who was injured by a roadside bomb which left his body paralyzed on one side. The local Holiday Fund. And others. We just simply feel good about making others feel good!

title: "Large Abstract painting - 24 X 72 Inches- JMJartstudio custom -Apples to Apples -Wall art-wall decor - 4 pc painting-Oil painting",
description: "Original large abstract canvas painting by JMJartstudio. This wall art measures 24 x 72 inches , it is a 4 piece painting. featuring shades of yellow, brown, gray, citron and red.This is a custom piece , it is painted to order. it will take up to 7 - 10 days for completion. My name is Sherri I found myself being inspired quite a bit by nature. This piece represents an apple tree to me. The green leaves , the red, apples , the white / gray center with a brown trunk. There are colors and inspiration all around us. I try to take the time to look at things differently more than what it is. More like what could it be. This is an original piece, I would consider each one of my paintings to be one of a kind . Since it is painted by me each piece I create is different and unique in its own way .I am proud to say all my paintings are Made in America, in my studio in New York each one is hand signed by me the artist.&quot; If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange apples you and I will each still have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange ideas then we will both have two ideas &quot; George Bernard Shaw They are painted on high quality 3/4 inch stretched canvas with a Gallery wrapped edge. What is STRETCHED canvas ? Stretched canvas means the canvas has been stretched and secured on a wooden frame. GALLERY WRAPPED simply means the canvas has been secured and stapled on the back to give the canvas a nice finished edge.This is a great thing since you will not have to buy a frame for your painting, it can be hung up straight from the box. What will your piece look like when you take it from the box. It will be carefully wrapped in bubble wrap to ensure its safe arrival . Did I mention that all of my pieces are fully insured so there are no shipping worries.OK back to the painting, once you remove the bubble wrap,first thing you will notice is the beautiful protective finish. I want your piece to last for years and years, it also make it easy to dust. You will see how this finish adds to the beauty of your painting, how the sheen plays off all the texture this piece is made up of.Look at the dark wash this piece has over it .Allowing every single nook and cranny of the texture to come alive. Creating interest and depth from every angle. Once your painting is displayed home you will notice people will be drawn to it, they will want to touch it .Guess what its OK let them because your painting is as durable as it is beautiful . Now take a look to the bottom right hand corner here you will NOT see my signature. .On occasion a piece may only be signed on the back . You wonder why ? I do this because I like to leave my clients options.the versatility of hanging your piece vertical or horizontal .This way it can be easily displayed in different areas of your home.With this piece the options are endless you can hang it as is , in a square, vertical ,together or separate the ideas are never ending have fun with it. Alright now that you took your treasure from the box what do you do with it ? Its simple, nothing special is needed, just a couple little picture hangers and you are all set.Generally a painting can be hung up within 5 minutes. You might ask why I don&#39;t use wire on my pieces ,its plain and simple , over the years I have seen those little wires and hooks create damage.Damage that I&#39;m not willing to risk your painting. It also will leave you that hanging versatility I mentioned above. I think I have covered everything ,but in case I didn&#39;t I would love to hear from you. If you have any questions send them along, want to share your space, ask for a suggestion, I would be happy to see your room. Send me a photo I am always glad to help.This is my favorite part I&#39;m going to ask a favor of you, if you would like to you to share a photo with me, of the painting hanging in your beautiful home. I would love to see it .This is one of my biggest enjoyments !! .
