If you absolutely require a tracking number from the US Mail, please let us know in a convo prior to placing your order, and we will let you know if an extra fee applies.  \r\n\r\nWhen delivering to residences, it is UPS and the US Mail&#39;s policy to not require a signature.  Should you require someone to sign for the package(s) please let us know and we can let you know what the additional cost would be.\r\n\r\nThe addressee MUST BE KNOWN by the Post Office, UPS, FED-EX or other delivery service to reside at the address you are shipping to.  If the addressee is not known to reside there, you MUST address the label with a C\/O (care of) someone that is known to reside there.\r\n\r\nIf you have us ship to an address, and the Post Office deems it to be UNDERLIVERABLE or UNDELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED or some similar terminology, and we have addressed the package as you have instructed, our obligation has been completed at that point.  Should the package be returned to us, we will contact you with a new shipping price to re-mail it to you.  Should the package not be returned to us, or returned damage, we will not be responsible for any refund or replacement of any amount.\r\n\r\nLOST PACKAGES SHIPPED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES:\r\nIf your package does not arrive by the estimated date provided by the post office, UPS or other delivery service, we will decide to either replace or refund your purchase 14 business days, excluding holidays, after the delivery service&#39;s estimated delivery date.  The only exception would be FIRST CLASS MAIL, which would be 21 business days, excluding holidays.  This will be an allowable timeframe for misrouted packages to arrive to you.\r\n\r\nWe have had instances where packages delivered to apartment buildings were delayed as the mailman decided not to leave the package in the hallway unattended.\r\n\r\nWhen we send you the shipping convo, it would be a good idea to arrange to have the package delivered to a neighbor (leave a note for the mailman) or ask the post office to hold any packages at the post office for you to pickup.\r\n\r\nUPS WILL LEAVE packages unattended, so you should definately arrange to be home or leave a note for the UPS driver to deliver to a neighbor.  The neighbor would need to be a next door apt as UPS will not deliver to another building free of charge.\r\n\r\nCANADIAN and INTERNATIONAL shipments: If you require a tracking number, UPS is the only option. Please contact us to see if the shipping charges shown in the listing is for UPS or Mail. Any duties and taxes will be the responsibility of the customer.  Shipments made to Canada or Internationally by a service other than UPS (ie: Postal Service) are not guarranteed as the tracking numbers are only good until the package reaches the US border, then the receiving country takes control.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSURANCE:  \r\nAll shipments ARE NOT insured.  Should you require insurance for lost packages, damage, etc, let us know prior to placing your order so we may give you a price.  Any packages delivered to you in a damaged condition MUST be reported to the delivery person BEFORE YOU SIGN for the package.  Any damaged packages that have not been reported to the delivery person before you sign, will not be refunded or exchanged by us.","policy_refunds":"Our items are all made to order, so once an order has been entered and work begun there is no way of refunding your purchase should you decide to cancel.

If there is a damaged product, you will need to send us photograph(s) clearly showing the damage.  We can instruct you as to what we need for photographs based on the product.  If a refund is issued we may require a photo showing the product is no longer usable.  This would require a photograph showing the engraving or other part of the product marred, scratched or otherwise rendered unusable.

If you absolutely require a tracking number from the US Mail, please let us know in a convo prior to placing your order, and we will let you know if an extra fee applies.  \r\n\r\nWhen delivering to residences, it is UPS and the US Mail&#39;s policy to not require a signature.  Should you require someone to sign for the package(s) please let us know and we can let you know what the additional cost would be.\r\n\r\nThe addressee MUST BE KNOWN by the Post Office, UPS, FED-EX or other delivery service to reside at the address you are shipping to.  If the addressee is not known to reside there, you MUST address the label with a C\/O (care of) someone that is known to reside there.\r\n\r\nIf you have us ship to an address, and the Post Office deems it to be UNDERLIVERABLE or UNDELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED or some similar terminology, and we have addressed the package as you have instructed, our obligation has been completed at that point.  Should the package be returned to us, we will contact you with a new shipping price to re-mail it to you.  Should the package not be returned to us, or returned damage, we will not be responsible for any refund or replacement of any amount.\r\n\r\nLOST PACKAGES SHIPPED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES:\r\nIf your package does not arrive by the estimated date provided by the post office, UPS or other delivery service, we will decide to either replace or refund your purchase 14 business days, excluding holidays, after the delivery service&#39;s estimated delivery date.  The only exception would be FIRST CLASS MAIL, which would be 21 business days, excluding holidays.  This will be an allowable timeframe for misrouted packages to arrive to you.\r\n\r\nWe have had instances where packages delivered to apartment buildings were delayed as the mailman decided not to leave the package in the hallway unattended.\r\n\r\nWhen we send you the shipping convo, it would be a good idea to arrange to have the package delivered to a neighbor (leave a note for the mailman) or ask the post office to hold any packages at the post office for you to pickup.\r\n\r\nUPS WILL LEAVE packages unattended, so you should definately arrange to be home or leave a note for the UPS driver to deliver to a neighbor.  The neighbor would need to be a next door apt as UPS will not deliver to another building free of charge.\r\n\r\nCANADIAN and INTERNATIONAL shipments: If you require a tracking number, UPS is the only option. Please contact us to see if the shipping charges shown in the listing is for UPS or Mail. Any duties and taxes will be the responsibility of the customer.  Shipments made to Canada or Internationally by a service other than UPS (ie: Postal Service) are not guarranteed as the tracking numbers are only good until the package reaches the US border, then the receiving country takes control.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSURANCE:  \r\nAll shipments ARE NOT insured.  Should you require insurance for lost packages, damage, etc, let us know prior to placing your order so we may give you a price.

We reserve the right to ship from either shops. \r\n\r\n*Ordering samples before a large order is prudent; however owing to the nature of our business, we cannot guarantee a sample and the final production will look &quot;exactly&quot; alike as we have different machinist and many machines that all engrave \/ print slightly different. If getting &quot;exact&quot; is critical, please let us know at order so we can find the previous order documents and make sure we use the same machinist to engrave the order. We may request a visual photo of the sample for a final reference.   \r\n","policy_seller_info":"PO Box 1538\r\nFresno, TX 77545\r\n1-800-925-7044","policy_updated_tsz":1455255726,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/TealsPrairie?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/030\/0\/8057725\/iusb_760x100.14286491_ae7v.jpg","num_favorers":21615,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":null,"is_using_structured_policies":false,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":false,"has_unstructured_policies":true}},{"listing_id":126209035,"state":"active","user_id":7005118,"category_id":69163983,"title":"Frye Campus Boots Vintage 1970s Whiskey Brown Square Toe Cowboy Leather Men&#39;s 10 1\/2","description":"Vintage Distressed Brown Leather Square toe Boots\r\nCirca 1970s\r\nMade by Frye Black Label\r\nMarked Men&#39;s size 10 1\/2 \r\nPlease follow these measurements to ensure proper fit\r\nMeasures 12.5 inches heel to toe outer sole\r\n4.25 inches across ball of foot\r\n1.5 inch heel\r\n13.5 inches high\r\n15.5 inches around calf\r\nLeather soles and rubber heels\r\nIn good distressed vintage condition-- shows wear, distressed,spots and scuffs and wear to soles and heels \r\n\r\nPlease feel free to send me a conversation with any questions you have or if you would like a domestic or international shipping quote based on your specific location.\r\n\r\nInternational Mail is shipped via Priority Mail\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Boots----&gt;

Each one features a promotional logo from a cigarette company. The logos were either applied by the glass manufacturer, or by someone that owned the glass ware. You can see where there was a glass type glue applied to the glass. The edges of each of the logos is also pulling up at the corners on a few of the glasses.\n\nThe glasses are in good vintage condition. They appear to have been hand blown glass. See photos for details. They do not have any chips or cracks. The applied logos are in good condition, but I would suggest that the glasses only be used for display. If you do actually serve with them, I would hand wash them, and not put them in the dishwasher.\n\nThe set would look great in your MCM living room or den. Very cool. They measure about 3 inches tall, and are about 3 inches in diameter at the top of the glass. I believe that you could also call them a double high ball size.\n\nThanks so much and please let me know if you have any questions about this listing.

Perfect to walk a small dog up to about 7 kg.","creation_tsz":1457556490,"ending_tsz":1468093690,"original_creation_tsz":1379117620,"last_modified_tsz":1457556490,"price":"55.00","currency_code":"AUD","quantity":1,"tags":["Kangaroo leather","Leather dog lead","Dog show lead","Plaited leather lead","Australian made","Kangaroo Dog Leash","Braided Leather Lead","Braided Dog Leash","Leather  Show Lead","Braided Show Lead","Leather Dog Leash","Purple Green White","Dogs"],"category_path":["Pets"],"category_path_ids":[68887434],"materials":["Kangaroo leather","Nickel plated clip"],"shop_section_id":12225775,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1456049431,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/162638419\/kangaroo-leather-dog-lead-braided-in?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":378,"num_favorers":25,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":3,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2016","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":"pets","occasion":null,"style":["Kangaroo Leather Dog Lead","Braided Leather Dog Leash"],"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":1387,"taxonomy_path":["Pet Supplies","Pet Collars & Leashes","Pet Leashes"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":501339996,"hex_code":"A18C6B","red":161,"green":140,"blue":107,"hue":37,"saturation":33,"brightness":63,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1379117620,"listing_id":162638419,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/023\/0\/7023801\/il_75x75.501339996_c4o2.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/023\/0\/7023801\/il_170x135.501339996_c4o2.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/023\/0\/7023801\/il_570xN.501339996_c4o2.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/023\/0\/7023801\/il_fullxfull.501339996_c4o2.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":501401425,"hex_code":"B29A75","red":178,"green":154,"blue":117,"hue":36,"saturation":34,"brightness":69,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1379117620,"listing_id":162638419,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/017\/0\/7023801\/il_75x75.501401425_ml1n.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/017\/0\/7023801\/il_170x135.501401425_ml1n.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/017\/0\/7023801\/il_570xN.501401425_ml1n.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/017\/0\/7023801\/il_fullxfull.501401425_ml1n.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":501341268,"hex_code":"A79276","red":167,"green":146,"blue":118,"hue":34,"saturation":29,"brightness":65,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1379117620,"listing_id":162638419,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/019\/0\/7023801\/il_75x75.501341268_hiv2.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/019\/0\/7023801\/il_170x135.501341268_hiv2.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/019\/0\/7023801\/il_570xN.501341268_hiv2.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/019\/0\/7023801\/il_fullxfull.501341268_hiv2.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":501402247,"hex_code":"958265","red":149,"green":130,"blue":101,"hue":36,"saturation":32,"brightness":58,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1379117620,"listing_id":162638419,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/020\/0\/7023801\/il_75x75.501402247_jkhe.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/020\/0\/7023801\/il_170x135.501402247_jkhe.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/020\/0\/7023801\/il_570xN.501402247_jkhe.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/020\/0\/7023801\/il_fullxfull.501402247_jkhe.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":501402067,"hex_code":"9E8768","red":158,"green":135,"blue":104,"hue":34,"saturation":34,"brightness":61,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1379117620,"listing_id":162638419,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/018\/0\/7023801\/il_75x75.501402067_cb37.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/018\/0\/7023801\/il_170x135.501402067_cb37.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/018\/0\/7023801\/il_570xN.501402067_cb37.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/018\/0\/7023801\/il_fullxfull.501402067_cb37.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500}],"Shop":{"shop_id":7023801,"shop_name":"LeadOnDogs","user_id":22408268,"creation_tsz":1342009734,"title":"Lead On","announcement":"Bespoke Plaited Kangaroo Leather Dog Leads\r\nfor showing, dog obedience or just walking your dog.\r\nHandmade especially for you.\r\nLeadOnDogs is happy to accept Custom Orders","currency_code":"AUD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":"LeadOnDogs is taking a short break.

In 2009, I created The Original Hand Stamped Vintage Coffee Spoon\u2122  \r\nI conceptualized, developed and created an entire product line that was not in existence until I made it!  The response was overwhelming!  To say that it was an amazing feeling, is an absolute understatement!  A concept so unique and so original, it developed into a full-time career upon launching.  In 2010, my decision to join Etsy would prove to be life-changing! Etsy has been an amazing platform for my business and I am grateful for the national and international exposure it has provided my ever-expanding product line.  \r\n\r\nThe Sycamore Hill Collection\u2122 started a hand stamped vintage flatware trend that spread nationally, as well as internationally! With sales in 27 countries to date, The Sycamore Hill Collection continues to grow and expand with new, always ORIGINAL, product lines. Known for unique, one-of-a-kind designs, Sycamore Hill is a trendsetter specializing in custom, handmade gifts and home decor.\r\n\r\nI invite you to visit my &quot;About&quot; page to learn the entire story behind the creation of The Original  Hand Stamped Vintage Coffee & Espresso Spoon Collection\u2122 with the hope that it inspires you!
