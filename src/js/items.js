Painting\n\nThis beach oil painting was painted on a 16x20&quot; canvas.  The beach painting captures the natural beauty of an untouched beached.  There are no condos or hotels in site.  The sandy dunes pile high upon the beach giving a home to the natural plant life that thrives there.  The sky in this oil painting shows light billowing clouds as the sunlight dances through.  I have always loved the beach and feel at home when I visit there.  This beach oil painting captures quiet and relaxing beach just waiting to be explored.  This oil painting is great for adding to your beach decor or even decorating a beach house.

This is an original acrylic painting on gallery wrapped canvas. It measures 30 x 40 x 1.5&quot;d. The sides are painted a sand color from the front and it&#39;s ready to hang as it is or be out into a frame. This painting is inspired by the San Francisco Bay Area where I live.\n\nThank you for looking.","creation_tsz":1457639201,"ending_tsz":1468176401,"original_creation_tsz":1457639201,"last_modified_tsz":1457639202,"price":"695.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"tags":["Coastal","seascape","painting","original art","acrylic","San Francisco","California","large","Colorful","Abstract","abstract landscape","pink"],"category_path":["Art","Painting"],"category_path_ids":[68887312,68890908],"materials":["Acrylic","canvas"],"shop_section_id":7853069,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1457639202,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/271760194\/colorful-abstract-landscape-painting?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":0,"num_favorers":0,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":3,"processing_max":5,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2016","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":["Abstract"],"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":106,"taxonomy_path":["Art & Collectibles","Painting","Acrylic"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":937583730,"hex_code":"A48E84","red":164,"green":142,"blue":132,"hue":19,"saturation":19,"brightness":64,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1457639201,"listing_id":271760194,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/126\/0\/5851455\/il_75x75.937583730_8sm9.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/126\/0\/5851455\/il_170x135.937583730_8sm9.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/126\/0\/5851455\/il_570xN.937583730_8sm9.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/126\/0\/5851455\/il_fullxfull.937583730_8sm9.jpg","full_height":1200,"full_width":884},{"listing_image_id":937583702,"hex_code":"AC9D94","red":172,"green":157,"blue":148,"hue":22,"saturation":13,"brightness":67,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1457639201,"listing_id":271760194,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/112\/0\/5851455\/il_75x75.937583702_mcmi.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/112\/0\/5851455\/il_170x135.937583702_mcmi.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/112\/0\/5851455\/il_570xN.937583702_mcmi.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/112\/0\/5851455\/il_fullxfull.937583702_mcmi.jpg","full_height":1200,"full_width":818},{"listing_image_id":937583656,"hex_code":"9A8A82","red":154,"green":138,"blue":130,"hue":20,"saturation":15,"brightness":60,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1457639201,"listing_id":271760194,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/129\/0\/5851455\/il_75x75.937583656_8yc5.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/129\/0\/5851455\/il_170x135.937583656_8yc5.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/129\/0\/5851455\/il_570xN.937583656_8yc5.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/129\/0\/5851455\/il_fullxfull.937583656_8yc5.jpg","full_height":1200,"full_width":895},{"listing_image_id":937583706,"hex_code":"AB988C","red":171,"green":152,"blue":140,"hue":23,"saturation":18,"brightness":67,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1457639201,"listing_id":271760194,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/114\/0\/5851455\/il_75x75.937583706_pd9j.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/114\/0\/5851455\/il_170x135.937583706_pd9j.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/114\/0\/5851455\/il_570xN.937583706_pd9j.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/114\/0\/5851455\/il_fullxfull.937583706_pd9j.jpg","full_height":895,"full_width":1200},{"listing_image_id":937583606,"hex_code":"AB9F92","red":171,"green":159,"blue":146,"hue":31,"saturation":14,"brightness":67,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1457639201,"listing_id":271760194,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/104\/0\/5851455\/il_75x75.937583606_7pzp.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/104\/0\/5851455\/il_170x135.937583606_7pzp.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/104\/0\/5851455\/il_570xN.937583606_7pzp.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/104\/0\/5851455\/il_fullxfull.937583606_7pzp.jpg","full_height":1200,"full_width":905}],"Shop":{"shop_id":5851455,"shop_name":"lindadonohue","user_id":9657430,"creation_tsz":1270249082,"title":"Linda Donohue Art","announcement":"Thank you for visiting!

Beautiful stylish wall art for your home and office decor.\r\n\r\nI Opened my Shop on Etsy on November 2, 2011. I have been in business on Etsy continuously since then. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m an Abstract Painter and Mixed Media Artist who is internally driven to paint every day. I&#39;m fascinated with the process of creating specific colors and combining mediums into the paint to create distinctive textures on a variety of surfaces. The whole experience of creating the art is an &quot;in the zone&quot; experience.   My intention is to transform a static environment into a space which is alive with interest and originality. I create original one of a kind paintings in many sizes on canvas, paper and wood. \r\n\r\nMy Original Paintings are being Showcased all over the world in Law Firms, Interior Design Firms, Hospitals, Office Buildings, Upscale Apartment Buildings, Hotels, Architectural Firms, Doctor&#39;s and Surgeons Offices. California Homestagers purchase my paintings to enhance and showcase their pricey listings on the Ocean and in Beverly Hills.  I work with art consultants in NYC who purchase my originals to enhance every type of exclusive buildings in New York including high end residential Penthouses and Apartments in Manhatten. \r\n\r\nMy work has been in Elle Decor Magazine when a clients loft space was showcased.\r\n\r\nI work with Art Dealers, Art Consultants throughout the US.\r\n\r\nI also have many, many Wonderful Residential Customers and Clients all over the country who are Art Collectors and who have their homes and vacation homes and beach houses filled with my original paintings. \r\n\r\nIn addition I regularly work with interior designers on residential and large commercial projects.
